Buying a home by shitposting on reddit. Not a bad deal. I'm in!
I will also hodl my moons. Yes, it might become worthless, but come on: It's not like we are losing actual money. But IF this is going somewhere, I will for sure not miss out on it.
>even 6 years from now, we will have the ability to use whatever coin or token you want with most real estate companies

I’m from the future and you’ll be very disappointed
What is a moon token?
!remindme 6 yrs?
Moons will only have as much value is someone else is willing to give it.


Much like the USD.
Go clean your room son! Do you have any idea how many shitposts I had to curate inorder to buy this house!
Buying my Lambo with moons
How many moons do you have (estimate is fine)?
I want in too! Subsidise my house, please.
Best you will be able to do is to buy škoda from 2010.
Instructions clear: Shitpost a fuck ton to accumulate moons
This fuckin sub..
Will my 13 moons make me rich?? Wen lambo??

Edit: 58 moons!!... Soon lambo!!
Same
Moons to the moon
Bullish on moons
I'd be more surprised if my Bricks get me anything. 

Also, I think hiphopheads is coming out with their own RCP
Just the beginning of the internet economy. We should all be paid for out content regardless of where it happens
**MOONS to $10 just a question of time!**
Millionaire mindset right here ↑
Moons to the *Moon* you say? Hopefully it works out!
HODL is the only option really
Moon would even go beyond Pluto by that time
Go Moons!
Deal, I’m in, but have a lot of work
Do we have another option? 🤔 Not sure I know how do anything with my moons.
Moons wont moon man
I’ve decided to make a goal to create enough shitpost until you gift me all your moons Mr OP!
Enjoy your mansion or cardboard box, there will be no in between
Post unclear, buying Reddit outfits with moons
RemindMe! 10 years
Lmao
This should be flagged comedy
Where is the comedy tag?
There is already ability to buy a home using crypto as deposit without credit scores or tax returns/income statements, waitlist is huge but it’s starting. You may be able to do this in 2-3 years if moons go mainstream
You mean all this shitposting really CAN pay the bills?  Fuck you mom, I win!

Edit: I love you mom, its just a joke.
Earning money by posting comments, what a time to be alive
And my aim is to save atleast 1 years rent amount with moons. Wen mainnet ? Wen 1 usd ?
Let the shill posts commence! Godspeed moon man
This post will be so huge that the moons you ll get for it will buy a summer house too .
I'm sure I'll be able to do this soon too with my little handful of them. I doubt it, but it would be nice.
When is the Coinbase listing???
Wait, you can sell/swap moons? Where?
Can we be neighbors?
Plan checks out unless Ukraine sparks a  thermonuclear war
Yeah Idk how to off ramp my moons, so I’m going to long term hodl until they are valuable AF.
Sounds like a plan to me!
Not Loops tho. This Sub hates the Loops
I’m gonna hold them just because I’ve been traumatized by too many instances of selling coins that moon after.
If my kids ever ask how I was able to afford the house: In my prime I was a content creator for 4.4+m people.
This is my only chance at owning a home. 

I’m IN.
That would be great 🍾🍾
Barbie houses are not that costly
X to doubt
Genious, 889 moons are going to be 1 Million in 2032. I think you will be able to buy a nice garage in NY.
I don't shit post enough, got to start so I can get a cabin
Just curious, what’s the current value of a moon?
Moon farming from shit posts! Let me hop on board this train!!
Ill be happy with a Harley motorcycle ngl
On Thanksgiving, I can tell the grandkids I bought this house by commenting "This is the Way" on hundreds of posts.
Remindme! 10 years
Also, don't forget to store your recovery phrase
Too Less moon and too less house
Anyone know the market cap for Moons and the total supply?
Big brain move. 

Post about wanting to hold Moons for 10 years, thus earning more Moons to hold for 10 years.
I’m not selling any moons til they hit a billion market cap at least
OP gonna buy a cardboard box ten years from now with those sweet moon gains
Sir, how did you gain this huge money, where you part of a successful company or CEO of huge company?

No no, I was a farmer before, posting shits and gaining moon, that is how I earn this huge fortune.
If you’re thinking along a 10 year time horizon, just stick to BTC dude. Hoping for moons to moon is probably the dumbest thing you can do.
#OP will be a moonillionaire!
10 years is too long for me. My city would already be submerged by sea water in the meantime.
!RemindMe 10 years
Count me in! I will hold my moons forever
It is my goal. I hope to buy a house with my moons too.
I am not as strong
Ah yes, I just need each moon to be 1000 usd
Moonionaire
wrong flair my dude, should be tagged as comedy
Good luck moon mate
People say buy the dip but I say hodl whatever coin u have and trust. The mooning part is always a few years away from today's path.
I need moons. I need as many as i can get. My lambo is depending on it.
for those seriously hodling moons for the long term (and why wouldn't you), it's probably best to swap your moons for USD now and buy back in.   


i'm not super familiar with tax laws but i imagine you'd pay taxes now as income, and later (since you've re-purchased them) they would be considered an asset and you would only pay a long term capital gains tax if applicable.   


would suck if moons went to the moon but you had to pay huge amounts of income taxes on a large sum for your shitposting.
I aspire to have this kind of hopeless optimism
What am I missing, as more moons get made to be distributed, over the time the value will continue to drop, it’s like inflation… soo good luck.
Moons to the moon!
Will moons always be limited to the cc page? Or will they be spread out to other pages too?
Moons will never moon. It’s actually impossible for them to moon. People have thousands of them for shitposting.
Tbh with so many bullish news surrounding the moons. I think we will be able to fulfill our dreams very soon.

Mainnet is around the corner.
Count me in bro, count me in.
One can dream, man. One can dream. ![gif](emote|moon_emote|moon)![gif](emote|moon_emote|moon)
I gonna invite all holders to my yacht
I think it’s the free money/karma glitch!
You son of a bitch, I'm in
I'm also in. I don't know about a home, but I'll settle with a lambo.
Me too. I will keep them as a souvenir... remember the good old times during the Pandemic Haha
It would be accounting nightmare for any company
Swapping for USD just before the purchase is not that hard usually
Well then I guess I’ll just have to find a home from another moon token holder that wants to sell directly ;)
Marty is that you?
If you are from the future, Does the future still have Covid-19 restrictions?
>57 min. ago

You're from the past, my man
What is moon
Open your vault
An addiction.
Won’t be much to see.
But remember, Moons can always go to zero, whereas we can always use dollar bills in the restroom.
I'll give you 2 shits per moon!
So we need a few eccentric billionaires to buy in?
“Dad, what did you used to post?”

“ALGO, ONE, ATOM, LRC son. We all shilled it a lot”

“*cough* Fucking legend!”
You forgot the s at the end of Lambo.
For my sake and yours, I hope 1 Moon buys a house
Quality shit-post with corn & Elon in it.
Is paving the way
Hopium at its finest! Thanks.

As the Oracle has foretold.
You have few sites on https://ccmoons.com
Hopefully we never have to say “This was the way”.
Siri set reminder for 2032 to check up on MackStokes 10 year goal.
Then make a new post saying that you earned more Moons and update on hodl progress, infinite Moons glitch
gonna be a long run, but it's worth the wait
Quite undervalued considering it has 7m market cap right now, I mean I am sure Reddit can absolutely make it reach at least 100M
goated comment
Just like all of us, moon holders!
Just buy an apartment high enough, you'll an apartment with sea view.
Bullish on Moons!! Definitely worth holding for long term
Count me in too (looks at own moons)
"Oh yeah that time - I remember. I lived on reddit for a few years."
“Hi, I’m looking to buy a nice 5 bed house with a private pool and facing the sunset”

“Sure, what’s your budget?”

“About 1,000,000,000 SafeBabyElon coins”
You guys realize that this is all programmable money right?  

The payment rail will allow the buyer to use whatever currency they want and the payee to receive it however they want.  Obviously swap fees apply.  

This type of thing is already happening.
Baby don't hurt me
It looks like you are asking about Moons.  The answer to your question may be found here in the official Moons FAQ: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki

Reddit’s token essentially
The question is not what is moon but when moon
True. But even then there are alternatives, like three shells, or a bidet.
Sorry I'm only trading for schmeckles rn.
& one post.
That's generally a fast-path toward acceptance...
lol, 

"did you not get rich from posting advanced DD?". 

"Nah, 10 'LRC! Bullish af!' posts per day did the job. I tried talking about tech, etc, initially. spent hours researching and writing messages with plots and all. For what? A single downvote!"
I'll take 10 then
This is the way
***INJECT IT !***
This is absolutely terrifying
This is the way.
With the NFT avatars already implemented in the app and soon to be useable it may be sooner than you think
If doge and shib got in top 10 we can get moons to top 100- top 50 can’t we?
1 moon = 1 house wen?
You lived on Reddit.

Maybe in the future you’ll live off Reddit ;)
*But Grandpa... you're saying the coins we use everyday to pay for everything weren't always so popular?*
Don’t hurt me, no more
Based and demolition man pilled
Just need moons to be on other exchanges, it is quite useless at this point, also, I believe it can have same marketing as Doge had last year. So yep
!remindme in 6years
Imagine if we will all end up living in reddit to escape the Zuckrrlizard Metaverse.
Come on Barbie
Yeah that’s a big one. Having access to the general public will make us boom for sure
6 years 9 months exactly!!!
What can I say, I love meme coins, lol
But i bought harrypotterelondarthvaderInu with my 1$ i should be rich in 3 days
*Food stamps or yacht baby!*
**Get rich or die tryin'.**
Unless you know how to use flash loans. Then you can make about $300k in 10 seconds. Wild times.
Unless you are a hedge fund and you can short the economy.
It is said you need two full crypto cycles to get rich.
"Nobody has gotten rich quick."
Grimacecoin would like to disagree with you.
Squid game token is the way
They do get rich quick, just becomes poorer quicker
But quick is the best way to get rich - Parenthood
Ill try to get poor and quick then 🧐
Yes, this is what I tell myself when my pro folio is down 35%
**TLDR:**  Leverage 125x not the way! HCA+HODL.
Too much greed is what kills people in market.
But 1 day here is 7 years on real market
>I hate the way crypto is portrayed to people as a get rich quick way, which it isn’t.

It can be but only if you gamble on low market cap shitcoins and get incredibly lucky and most people aren't that lucky
They’ll lose money by panic selling…
Define rich...
Time in the market >
You can be as patient as a cum and stake dca and hold and still pick all the wrong coins and still be poor as shit it doesnt matter, its just luck
TL;DR: Hodl!
True. We've got to focus on solving real problems. Until we do, the critics are closer to right.

 https://link.medium.com/R9KHWVD99mb
Argh man don't. Only been in for a few months, tried to sell it to a whatsapp group of 10 people and 6 of them messaged me asking how much I'd made already. As if you just pick something and make instant money.
Some of you need to learn how to take profits, otherwise you will lose. Remember Steem, Aion, Bitshares etc. It's just a reminder that your favorite altcoin will probably be dead in few years.
U need a gazillion luck of good early investment or fuck your brains for a few decades. Either way, you win!
Think the majority of the ppl in this sub understands that and are in it for the long term, no?
Im trying to be poor quick, but why am I getting successful at being poor?
I've been in crypto for about a year now, and must admit that last summer I doubled my money, and hesitated to take it off. But in the end I didn't do it, even though it feels contradictory I feel like I just have to wait a few years at least
Objective try to get rich slow
You can with a dao promising 500000% APY.
According to this sub, the fastest way to get rich is to stop buying Starbucks.

Follow me for more tips.
Some people get rich. Usually the insiders or VCs that control the supply of the small tokens. 

A few smart minnows can snatch up some big gains before running off. 

99.9%  are just plankton that get swallowed up and then pooped out. 

There's always big news when someone wins a lotto ticket, but nobody talks about the millions of others that got nothing.

Relatable. Down a couple of K hoping to get a couple of M
If only there was a crypto that would monetize your patience..
Might as well cut your losses at this dip the last few hours
Crypto is all about TO THE MOON 🚀
you need to see crypto manager if you couldnt get rich!

This is the way for americans to get into lobbying for crypto i guess, why not?
I would probably give, but only if not hyper focused on only one thing, such as only concerned about putting in a particular coin as legal tender.  I would have to see what it stands for first.
This is realistically the only way crypto has an easy run at adoption in America. Look at how much control the Lobby’s have. Association with as much power as the NRA (amongst others) don’t exist in most countries because the rules around political donations for influence are (mostly) strictly monitored. If you want to make big money in America you have to spend big money. Capitalists heaven, everyone wants a cut of the pie.
It's a good move for crypto's interests but is in line with everything wrong about politics
take over the world away from big tech!
Isn't Charles the one that left Ethereum because he wanted a For Profit project and now he is the one asking to volunteer and donate?
I think it’s a great idea. Better than politicians being influenced by the big banks
I’d totally join. I wonder how we would raise money. We’ll call this PAC DAO
Clearly it needs to be done.
I cant donate I am rich enough.
I can spare a few dollars as this would benefit crypto overall!
I'd be willing to part with a few coins

Yeah, but, Charles isn’t head of it so he wants to start a new one… a better one… with MORE democracy… that will get less done in a much longer timeframe….
Is it peer reviewed?
It'll be coopted by right wing extremists since they act like parasites and have used crypto as a way of of funding their extremism. It is sad that such scum has brought negative attention to this tech.
Didn't think of it this way, but you bring up a good point
When he's the billionaire, yes. He also said we was going to lead a march on Washington DC in August and never did. Guess something came up.
Thoughr he left because he simply did not agree with Vitalik on some stuff such as the initial release when not everything was 100% revised and tested, and the hacking that led to the ETC fork. But idk much.
You realize Charles is a billionaire, right?
Me too
I didn't say it!!! 🤣
got it, this helps. I thought it was all over because he insisted on ETH foundation to be a for project project.

NFTs were supposed to be a beneficial change in tech but it’s just turned into a shameless cash grab for all involved
A bubble, within a bubble, within a bubble?
Even my morning shit has a better purpose than NFTs.
NFTs are also kind of too big to go to zero now specially after all the big artists are in it.
NFTs will be huge in the future though. 

I feel like they opened awhole new era of technology. Personally really stoked to see them in use within the gaming & music industry.
For now, yes for sure, the majority of crypto currencies are a pesculative bubbles to be honest, meme coins are the best example, but there are already useful nfts being created as we speak, and when they are completed we wil finally see true value with this technology
For reference global art market is valued at 50 billion. This is a bubble.
Ape or rock NFT are pure garbage without any use case
While I do think NFTs are in a bubble, you still do t know much about NFTs. They do much more rather than represent digital art and authentic certification.
As opposed to the entirety of crypto?
All crypto is speculation, but I agree NFTs are awful in their current form.
I don't think anyone disputes nfts are in a bubble
Life is pure speculation.
NFTs like BAYC is basically the Greater Fool Theory in a nutshell.  It’s going to be comical when the bubble bursts.
lol, I managed to flip some uncommon skins on crypto royale. Made a profit each time, but man, shit made me feel quite uneasy. Like eventhough I only bought when someone listed them way below what others were charging, I felt like this shit is worthless.
Bubbles everywhere!
In the current state jpeg memes and pictures of monkeys, yeah I agree with you. 

However I think nfts are gonna be a big part of our future as they have literally loads of use cases
We could say it’s overvalued but by how much? We’d be hard pressed to find that number

The lesson here is just not FOMO into NFTs. Coins are already risky enough as it is. But if anyone finds good artist or an NFT collection that is used as entry to a game then it at least has some use

Edit: strictly speaking about NFT art
Some NFTs give you some indirect benefits like the Bored Ape NFTs give you access to Bored Ape Yacht Club so it's like an entry ticket to an exclusive group of wealthy people.
Until it has some real life use cases ofcourse!
Everything’s a bubble if you think hard enough
monkey picture no go up?
Once EA and companies put them in games I wonder howblong people will still call them a bubble for
Did you all watched SpongeBob? You know what a bubble all can do
It's crazy. People either love or hate NFTs. There is not much in between.
Pot calling the Kettle black.
> crypto is a bubble and it runs on pure speculation 

FTFY
I don't know about apes, but the technology is here to stay.
Ill be a proud holder of bored ape club ngl
I think that's because it's the easiest way right now. Microsoft just dumped 27 million into a NFT company. We have t seen anyone really grasp them at a large business scale yet.
Within a bubble
Bubbleception
It's bubbles all the way down.
Well, It's time to sell that shit on opensea
Let me introduce you to gaming NFTs. Case study: CSGO weapon skins and marketplace. Another case study: league of legends champion skins can’t be bought/sold by players on a marketplace, so players that are done with the game have sunk money into the game that is now permanently gone, whereas if the skins were readable on the market, they’d be able to sell their in-game assets on an open market without a middleman skimming off the top. Last case study: Gods unchained is a great game, loads of fun, and utilizes NFTs as the playing cards which creates an online marketplace similar to the physical trading card games such as yugioh or Pokémon: rare cards with visible circulating supply, verifiable ownership etc. NFTs are more than just art…
You're on to something here...
Real bubble
it's for rich people to show off how much they don't need the money
Their only use case is bragging rights apparently.
But we don't get bubble butt
Don't joke, if he did he could probably buy a house... well, perhaps one needs a shit collection? One for every day of the year? Hmmm.... 💡
I Will finish your last sentence. "NFTs are more than just art, they are pure digital fart."
Like most thing in life... weird a community that constantly says they want Lambos would be against bragging rights. Lambos are terrible cars and personal property tax is insane on them.
That's some good shit bro
Ok… I don’t think you understand that I agree with the million Dollar Jpegs being stupid, overinflated etc, but NFTs can have major industry benefits for supply chain management and gaming micro-transactions. It’s just a fact and they don’t need to be millions of dollars. I play a NFT hearthstone-like game called gods unchained which allows me to sell my NFT cards I earn from playing the game or buy new cards on the market. I have sole ownership of them, I can lend them out for free to a friend for him to complete his deck, I can hold the good ones in anticipation that they will be more sought after in the future, etc. Traditional games don’t allow that much flexibility because their in game assets are just IOUs and they skim off the top of any sales on their marketplaces. Anyways, you can stay away from it, but don’t be surprised to see more and more of it popping up.
Well let's hope some buyers think that 😂

Dig Dug NFT that shit.
Thoughts….. give me one!!!
ATARI has made so.many childhoods amazing and I'm sure this would.go.high price
Gamers will hate it but they also hate microtransactions and triple A games getting released unfinished messes at full price yet it's the norm lol, if the companies can make money off it they'll do it and it won't be stopped
Tempting LOL
Any info of where or when these would be on sale would be greatly appreciated…. Oh and a Paper Boy or a Super Bug NFT please!!
they are great at making worst decisions
Everyone is creating NFTs now lol
I’d want the Atari E.T. game NFT lol
For the right price I’d probably get one
That’s their hope I’m sure.  Nostalgia sells
I know right
I know, I will the article had more details.  I guess they haven’t released the specifics yet
That do have a bad track record
Yeah definitely, but anything “nft” seems to x25
tldr; Apifiny has entered a $530 million agreement with Abri SPAC I to become a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Founded in 2018, Apifiny was granted a US FINRA broker-dealer license last year.

hard to come up w/ reasons to be bearish (mass adoption started)
Congrats!
Spac is an interesting choice.  Probably wise the founders are looking to cash out.
Eek ... crypto exchange AND a SPAC. I dunno man, sounds risky. Coinbase hasn't done too great, this should be fun.
Saylor is a legend!
Breaking: guy who owns 121k bitcoins predicts that BTC will reach over $6m
He has truly diamond balls, buying BTC and holding it.
If you send him one bitcoin he will send you two! J/k lol
**Someone with brains!**
Be careful with some of the video on YouTube as they are scams also he use to be a manager at McDonald’s
17k btc... I'm trying to work my way to 1
Bitcoin Whale Michael Saylor
Typical Go with your gut guy! I like it
Best thing is He is a HODLER
Gotta stop myself from watching him on you tube, makes me want to go out and buy more BTC every time!
I think he is good for Bitcoin as a whole but it does concern me just how much Bitcoin he has
Saylor has 17,000 bitcoin personally lol
Definitely interested to see how his company does with this massive BTC holding. I wonder what the benefit is for holding so much
Whether or not you agree with his methods his opinions on traditional finance and the fiat system are pretty spot on
BTC big bull Michael Saylor
A Whale
When does he sell? how does he make profit?
He is the currency/asset messiah. Brought down from the heavens beacuse Jesus can't understand what the hell he's saying.
The saying goes "never put all your eggs in one basket"
He's a kraken!
Who?😂😂

I bet that dude mines too
I don’t think I can fathom having 121,000 BTC
A Bitcoin Maxi with a lot of bitcoin haha
He’s been in the internet game a long time. He was the first purchaser and still holder of Michael.com, and probably bought that shit over a 14.4 modem.
![gif](giphy|mSHy1uJ2xhDBqZ9Sx6)
No, $10M! Or $15M, why does it bother you if it goes up to $20M?
Saylor is single minded in his pursuit - I'm not sure if its completely driven by money if you listen to his interviews, he is adamant that bitcoin is the future.
I wonder who stands to benefit most 👀
Lol love to see that no matter how much you own, you just hope it'll blow up
But *why* does he own that much Bitcoin? Could it be *because* he thinks it will reach $6M?
Or 0.1
He is very convincing isn’t he.
He doesn’t, he probably takes loans out with his bitcoin as collateral and writes off the debt to minimize any sort of taxes. 

Some ape brain 4D chess I guess
# There’s no second best
holly molly I did not know that.
Lets start with 100k
Or 0.01
Haha
Sometimes I wonder why people doubt or bad mouth crypto…

This is the shit that causes it.
I converted all my shitcoins for AVAX, I don't know why I am writing this here  but I have finally stopped believing in shitcumshots to moon fundamentals.  :)
McDonald’s should be liable for not thinking before tweeting. If Burger King joked about a Whoppercoin and didn’t actually make one obviously someone will capitalize and rug pull what did they expect?
I just give birth to shit
It weeds out all the incompetent ‘investors’
Welcome to the world of internet memes and crypto culture
Meta twitter discord i know reddit is next
Twitter banter giving birth to a coin is not that different from memes giving birth to a coin and we've had memecoins for like forever man
The number one threat to cryptocurrency is crypto. Bitcoin could be displaced by Ether, which could be displaced by Doge which could be displaced by HamsterCoin and then there's CobraCoin what could MongooseCoin do to CryptoCoin?
Anyone who thinks that the Grimacecoin someone is shilling has any potential has more problems than owning a shitcoin
A drunken click of seven buttons can create a new coin..
We'll call it "DogeLite".
Remember when omicron news broke out and someone made a coin with same name and it pumped 900% in first hour.
Need I remind you of squidgame? There's loads people will capitalize on, to screw others over with, if they get the chance.
Come on mate this can hardly be a surprise for you at this point.
Scammers gonna scam, a similar thing used to happen with made up websites and numbers.
Isn’t the first time, floki inu was made when Elon got a shiba inu dog posted it on Twitter and named it floki, that’s just one example
I think of them like lottery tickets... I never play the lottery
Liable how? How could they be held account? They didn't do anything illegal and this market is unregulated, it's fair game
The thing with lottery tickets is that you hit a jackpot only once per ticket, same is with these shit coins. They touch their ATH only once and then  Fade into nothingness (mostly). You'd probably never see them 🚀 again. People need to understand that the lottery ticket that they are buying in the hopes of winning a jackpot is already a used ticket.
Liable in the sense of answering for it, like who runs the marketing for the Twitter account, obviously not something you can be sued for but definitely out a spotlight on the person who hyped up a non existent coin. It’s no different then if John Cena tweeted about a “Cenacoin” that didn’t exist, only for one to be made and rug pulled, then John going “uh I didn’t actually do anything” like yes lol yes you did

They don't allow you to buy crypto that way? Do they just block the transactions?
Because they need their client money to buy the dip.... F Banks!

A credit card isn't *your* money
yep transactions doesn’t work with a credit card. It’s prohibited by most canadian banks

There’s multiple stories of clients calling RBC to let the transactions pass and the bank workers BEGGING them to have a friend invest in crypto for them bro.

Everyone here always talks about whale manipulation
Big money manipulates all forms of investment assets. Crypto is not alone. Sadly us shrimp can just sit on the sidelines and watch.
Hard to get manipulated if you just HODL, DCA, and/or buy dips as more and more adoption (including by financial institutions) occurs
Most people know this and have for ages.
I mean yeah. Big money controls most of the liquidity and therefore they can cause major price swings
More big money investment equals higher prices equals more capital required to move the market.

The opportunity cost is weighted towards missing out, so if you're a hedge fund priming an entry but not yet ready for spot it makes perfect sense to Short the price for as long as it takes to get your position.

With prices being higher and more capital being required to move BTC 1 percentile either way, it also stands to logical reason that the market is also less volatile in terms of price swings, even when the same amount of money is entering/leaving.
I think everyone pretty much know it
Is it not? I mean everyone acknowledges the bears here
Does big money manipulate the stock market as well since it's also taking a hit?
"People" don't care who is behind it. They just want to see "green."
Every plankon I know is aware of the whale movements.
Whales doing whale thing
There is evidence of manipulation all the way back to the very first bill run to $27 on Mt. Gox. Must have been like child's play for them back then.
There’s so much uncertainty with Biden’s Executive Order, FED talk of WAY Over-Tightening Regulation, and high inflation; these could be very toxic aspects on the utility, price, and principles of many tokens/coins.
Yeah, everyone here knows. We've known for a while.
This is why you need to Hodl and not play their games in the long run you will be in profits
I'm pretty sure its completely obvious to most people here.
Lol every other post on this sub talks about whales and price manipulation.
Not always. Only when things are down. You don’t hear much “hey everyone be aware of all the manipulation going on” when BTC is mooning.
Maybe OP is the only one that was oblivious to it?
EXACTLY! Every time goofies panic sell, it gives the whales more leverage. Every time you buy when the market dips and don’t panic sell, the whales lose a tiny bit more leverage each time.
Mooning : “it’s organic, crypto is the future! Fuck you boomers.”

Dumping : “WTF, manipulation!!”
"Just the tip"
When I see Brazil, government and investment on the same text, I only see a new form of corruption.

Sadly but true.
Rio dipping the toes to test the waters early

Better option than other countries trying to play catch up later down the line and jumping in with cannonball dive

That rescue package from 2020 isn't working out so well is it. Governments around the world made us taxpayers pay the ' covid relief ' and now their spending is being relieved by higher living costs for the ordinary man.
Rates go up. The market will have already factored this news in by the time it happens but you’ll still read tons of news articles about how it will effect the markets when it happens.
and the downtrend continues
Oh well, ramen til march it is
Damp et
Hopefully they stick to their guns, inflation has to be curtailed. Can't keep passing the buck
Pump it til March boys
last rate hike in beginning of 2021 coming out of lockdowns sent bitcoin way up! 

just sayin. Bullish
What day in March is this announcement expected?
tldr; The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it is likely to hike interest rates in March and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month in what US central bank chief Jerome Powell pledged will be a sustained battle to tame inflation. "The committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that the conditions are appropriate for doing so," Powell said.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*
How would hiking rates affect crypto prices?
So 40 percent inflation until March? Good thing we raised the minimum wage to 15. Now people will only need to earn 31 more dollars an hour to get ahead.
It’ll just go up eventually even if it doesn’t happen in march
Sometimes factoring it and experiencing it are two different things.

Just like ppl know taxes are due soon, they could still place some safer bets now til tax due date vs actually not being able to make those bets at tax due date because they paid up taxes.
It's not the start of a bear market, it's been a bear market for some time now.
I’m feeling like I need more Bitcoin
Wait until the $2 billion in BTC options expire tomorrow. We'll most likely see huge liquidations and a huge dip.
My cholesterol is a little high
I’m still gay
Scared
I’m feeling just fine.
I've only been in crypto for about a year so for me this is just another great opportunity to heavily DCA. I think the price will stay around this level for a few months.
No emotion
I would say it is a good time to buy if you want to. It is difficult to predict short term price movement on any coin/token.
Overwhelmed
Take a breath, zoom out, it’s a global market.. volatility is a given.
I'm pissed that White Castle canceled "fine dining" on Valentine's Day. Other than that, I'm feeling pretty good.
Bored. By looking at these charts.
Feel amazing but ate too many edibles again
Blue chips are at great prices right now
Think I ate some bad sushi, but other than that my boat’s afloat
Its about to pop off. Thats why big businesses are buying as much as they can.
I need "a" Bitcoin.
My blood pressure aswell...
So you're happy.
I feel the same.  I think we are in a channel that will trend sideways or even a little more downward, depending of the moves of the stock market.  I don't forsee a meaningful change this quarter.
After being solidly in the green for the last half of 2021, it feels weird I'm not negatively effected by everything going red.  I'm looking at it in the long term though.  So that helps.
Agreed.
Wouldn’t the volume be sky high if that were the case?
Keep stacking you’ll get there
And he knows it. Clap your hands.
Idk. But crypto is going to replace all world currencies eventually. Its part of the grand plan. 1 world government, 1 world religion, 1 world currency. Until then the big guys are gonna keep playing down the value and importance of crypto so they can acquire it at lower cost and so that me and you think its a bad idea.
I love your energy man. I hope this is the case but my gut says it’ll be regulated and then merged into our current broken structure, see the digital yuan for reference. I realllly hope I’m wrong though.
Facebook wants to lead that space, doesn't mean that they will. 

Nokia wanted to lead the smartphone market. AOL and yahoo wanted to lead internet service...
The question is, will there be hookers and blow in the metaverse?
Crypto idea is silly

- most of us in 2014 when we first heard about it
Meta may be hyping it. But they aren’t the only ones in this tech. People who are heavy into VR are already into it. For sure I’m not excited about Meta’s version of this. But other companies may do something very cool. I mean look at the money that’s already being thrown into digital real estate. Sandbox is a good alternative to Meta.
People are getting excited at the idea of another mania phase where they can make lambo money. No one cares about the metaverse.
In its current design it is, but its hard to imagine upcoming layers. 

Would you think in 2000s that some internet 01010101010s will be worth a lot?
They don't even know what they'll do in the metaverse, just getting excited seeing the hype around it
Facebook is not defacto leader of Metaverse.  Unfortunately their involvement has infact muddied the water and badly swayed people's perception to think of it as just some crypto related second life.

True metaverse will be an interconnected ecosystem of different platforms - rely heavily on VR and AR, and is many years away from true fruition but companies are already jumping on board even though the ecosystem or tech to make it a real world changer isn't there yet.
As an Introvert I will take metaverse over real world any day
Just like NFTs, I think the metaverse isn’t fully mature enough in terms of its capabilities

It will definitely a thing of the future, but yeah the way it is now its just second second life
I don't even know what metaverse is.
FUK Metaverse
Baby steps. But the future will hold a place for this. The next generation are the ones who will utilize this technology more. They want to present it like it's a fully fledged idea but in reality it's just opening the door to possibilities we haven't even thought of yet.
Think for a moment and figure out what the ideal meta verse looks like to you. An example for me is before I had a significant other, when I went shopping I had to see what I wanted. I couldn’t really keep a grocery list because it’d always be simple stuff that was easy enough to remember. But when I went in store I would say “yeah, I could use lunch meat.” 

If I were on an app, similar to instacart etc. I would have to look it up or check out previous purchases. In the meta verse I hope I can see a store that is lined with items I’ve never even thought to look at. Let alone asking a friend if they want to go shopping real quick so I can bullshit with them all the while. 

That’s just one idea from one person on what the meta verse could change in the future. (Facebook) isn’t fed information from idiots on a whim. There’s a reason they know what you’re probably doing, and a reason their algorithms know a broad spectrum of what you want to be doing..
Before we even get to metaverse we've kinda gotta back up and rethink/fix a lot of things. The critics have some good points.

 https://link.medium.com/R9KHWVD99mb
I can see the appeal of an alternate VR world where you’re a completely different person. It’s an escape for some I guess. Not saying the idea is great or anything I’m just saying I see the appeal
While I'm not a fan of the idea itself I do have some MANA. Can't help but feel bullish on it with everything in that realm ramping up.
Ready Player One etc.

You won't think it's so silly when crypto gamers are earning more than salaried workers, just as pro esports players are now.

Whilst they are celebrities earning megabucks, play to earn offers the potential to make a viable salary that at least competes with, if not exceeds national minimum wage structures.
I don't think a lot of people here grasp how money works or do any research... 

Second Life was racking in 100 million a year a decade after release. It's still pushing 50K users almost top ten if it was on steam almost 20 years after being released. 

Real life companies were buying land in game for advertising and studies.
I guess it's time to invest in metaverse coins since so many are against it in this sub lately
Ready player one
Big companies don’t get involved for nothing. They’re smarter than all of us. Don’t underestimate the power of a NFT, otherwise you’ll miss out on what could possibly be the next big thing. Invest in the Metaverse platforms and the ideas within the NFT ecosystem..
Facebook isn't the only company building a Metaverse tho. In the end, it'll be up to you to decide which company's Metaverse to use.
Looks like a RuneScape with companies now
What happened to flairs? I can't set one.
Fully agree with you here mate. I'm not hype at all by this metaverse and I don't know anyone irl who is.
Bullish on Facebook's failure
Hitler wanted to lead the world...
Maybe. Would you like to be one?
There are in gta 5 and there is mod to play on vr
This whole idea seems to hinge on vr adoption, and I dont really see that. I doubt a critical mass of users will like a state of blindness. After so many broken cups of coffee the vr sets will gather dust. AR is a whole different beast though
We are basically at a dial-up stage right now.
I thought so too, then I worked retail and witnessed the normal people and their love for browsing items, on the hunt for their next precious. It's such a basic human drive, vr cant replace that
Ready Player One...
Maybe it's better that way?
I like this vignette a lot, thanks for sharing
Sure why not
When Star Citizen is finally released I'll start getting hyped about metaverse.  (Not gonna pass up buying opportunities though, that'd be silly).
It 100% can. I would never shop if I didn't have to. I hate grocery stores. 

The feeling of looking for an upgraded item in game is nothing like that at all.
Of course, everyone likes to look at the trillions of reasons why it would never suit them as opposed to the 10 reasons it would be perfect for them, if only for an hour out of their week.
Be advised, the website cointelegraph.com has proven to be an unreliable source of information.

They have to pass the bill to "find out what is in it"

Our elected officials.
tldr; Crypto policy advocate Jerry Brito has called on US residents to contact their elected officials over possible privacy and due process concerns in a new bill proposed by the US House of Representatives. The bill would give the Treasury Secretary of the Treasury "unchecked and unilateral power to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions."

Blows my mind that they just tag these unrelated topics into larger bills

The first and most important part of staking is withdrawing from coinbase to the native wallets of the coins you hold. Coinbase staking is literally garbage.
I would recommend Crypto.com.  Between the Earn feature in the standard app as well as the DeFi Wallet (separate app, but you link it to the CDC app) you can earn solid staking returns on a number of coins.  I’m staking CRO (12.5%), ATOM (14.5%), and BTC (6.5%, but I have the Jade Visa card which is why it’s that high) right now through them.  If you manage to get on of the higher tiered debit cards at some point, that will also result in higher yields with their Earn program.
This guy [summed it up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y/htmlview?usp=sharing&pru=AAABfpCb3zs*-Fr0L3zMSzxFZdwcsjG8Zg)
I'd go with Algorand and become a governor.  Excellent rate of reward.
If you’re staking atom, download Keplr wallet for 14% and eligible for airdrops. If you need any help, ask cosmosnetwork sub.
Gemini earn is pretty cool and easy
Algo hands down !
ALGO is your answer. Best for staking
You could try [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) and stake stable coins for 12/10/8% APY and if you have ruby or indigo card you get dot 12.5% Polygon 12% ETH 6.5% DAI 12%
I stacked a few dollars and threw it away #thatscrypto
[removed]
Idk where you should start but anything offering you over 1000% APY is definitely a scam.


*Good Luck!*
I recommend  Elonballs. That one has huge potential. Jk
Staking on a coin’s native wallet is a great idea, when possible. It’s not always because of a higher apr, but from getting notifications of news and drawings, as well as airdrops that you don’t need to jump through hoops to be eligible for.
Do you have any recommendations for popular native wallets? Also, do you mean like finding a wallet for each coin?
Thanks for the info, also Will I earn much if I don’t use their cards?
Damm that’s a lot, thanks
Do you recommend I just use ALGO’s native wallet for this?
Will I earn much if I don’t use their card plans? I don’t want to spend too much money on it
I’ll make sure of that, thanks lol
That's simply not true lol
Yess, for Ada you can use yoroi for staking, for atom you can use Keplr, algo has its own wallet, and so on. Its safer than staking on exchanges plus the apy is reasonable bigger
It depends on what you have. Almost all cryptos have a native wallet where you will get the best staking rates. All in one wallets usually restrict your choice of validators and can sometimes even prevent you from being eligible for airdrops. A jack of all trades is a master of none.
There are too many to list. The easiest way to find one is to go to a project’s webpage and 9/10 times it’s advertised on the front page. But there are definitely other places to stake that are as good or better than a native wallet. Not trying to shill here, but I do lending terms on Nexo, and recently got a notification that AXS gets 32% apr for the next two months. I had some axs sitting on an exchange so I sent it over and now I’m earning a little extra.
It depends what you’re looking to stake, but it’s not a deal-breaker.  Anything in the DeFi Wallet, including CRO and ATOM (which are the highest APY return projects by quite a bit on there), the Visa card has no bearing on.  There’s a perk through their Earn program that with higher tiered cards, you get an additional 2% in staking rewards…so for instance without the card a 3-month stake of BTC yields 4.5% whereas with the card it’s 6.5%.  It’s absolutely worth it either way.

There are plenty of schemes out there that promise a bazillion % return which I don’t trust.  If you’re looking at decent returns at fairly low risk for legit projects, I’d definitely recommend CDC.
Yes, without the card is 10% the highest with the lowest at 2% depending on the period (3mo/1mo/flexible). I highly recommend the card as you get cashback on your purchases. In the last 3 months of use i got like 300£ in cashback which i bought CRO and stake it.   Don;t rush to a decision, make sure you research your staking platform first.
Are you talking about liquidity pools or staking?
Thanks for the info!
Got it, thanks!
Oh I see, thanks!
Are there any fees or anything where I would have to end up paying after a while?
Definitely will take time to research. Thanks!
I can only speak what I know but specifically, on Cronos, mm.finance has mmf staking (savanna) for CRK currently at 500% Apr. I collect that percentage every day and turn it into more mmf to get more rewards. 

They're promotional rates but there's nothing stopping you from hopping around to each of these projects and just selling back into your coin. In my case, mmf.

There's like 10 different options if you didn't like CRK but I don't have any loyalty and just sell for more mmf.

It's simply not true that high apr = scam. Risky? Absolutely.

From lurking and then joining this sub, it would appear that most people here don’t like NFTs in their current form but are well aware and excited about future applications (ownership, medical records, tickets, etc.) that NFTs have. It will take a while for the general public to get over the “tulip” craze currently surrounding the monetized jpegs being sold as “art”.
Those monkeys are ugly anyway. Serve no purpose at all.
I made one of these things from scratch using JavaScript. It’s quite fun and easy if anyone wants to try
If 99% of the NFT market is stupid (like you say), then NFTs are shit. 

Imagine if people only 3d printed replica dog shit and sold them. Would we still claim 3d printing is the future and post about all the cool theoretical use cases? Would anyone take it seriously?

My point is someone or some company needs to put out a useful NFT to change perception. It can't be 99% shit with theoretical use cases.
Certainly does seem like the Tulip mania. At the very least though NFT art could be used as fundraising mechanism if for nothing else
I haven't even heard any good theoretical use cases. Every time "good use cases" of NFTs are mentioned, they fall apart after thinking about them for even a few minutes. Registry of deeds, concert tickets, proving authenticity of designer objects, etc. None of it really works. None of it is easier or better with NFTs, and in fact making these things NFT based is much worse than the current system.
I agree but hope someone has a great idea. Currently it is a solution looking for a problem.

Nope.

If tether hits 2$
Top sign crypto winter is upon us: Motley Fool recommending crypto

Everything they've touched has gone to shit for quite awhile now.
If we enter a true bear market, we should hope it stays above 50 cents
Will LRC Hit 5$ in 2022?

Will BTC Hit 100k$ in 2022?

Will VET Hit 1$ in 2022?

Will ETH Hit 5k$ in 2022?

Will LINK Hit 48$ in 2022?

Will XLM Hit 2$ in 2022?

Will NANO Hit 17$ in 2022?
Worst source ever.
No
Maybe $1.25 lol
So the best case scenario for ADA is just a return to its previous ATH?
It will go up or down
let's focus on staying above $1 first
Only if BTC breaks downtrend and recovers
50/50
Who knows if btc goes to ath maybe
If BTC up ofcourse Cardano will go to 3$ with dapps.
tldr; Cardano (ADA) is the world's sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market value. It surged more than 600% last year and is now trading for a little more than $1. The blockchain launched smart-contract functionality and is working on another important element: transaction speed. If network development and Hydra progress go smoothly, it's very possible Cardano could reach $3 this year.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*
Yes, I believe so, but not until the second half of the year, at the earliest.
It better
Nobody knows shit about fuck.

^(So yeah, probably $3 is achievable)
I fucking hope so! I bought in at around $2.
The tingle in my sack says of course it will.

Or maybe I’m overdosing on hopium
If I had to say either way, I'd lean towards yes.

I'm more confident of $5 by EOY 2023 than $3 by 2022 EOY though
It might... since it's anchored to my hat... Haha
Yeah, this. We need fulfilled promises and a bull market to reach $3.
No 
Yes 
Yes
Yes
No
Yes
No
No
Yes
Yes
?
It may also go sideways for a little
I am sure it will go to the right
fulfilled promises? guess it’s fucked then.

Dot is a long term hold...and should definitely be in ones portfolio
No cap. Inflationary 6-10%

That said, I like DOT overall.
Parachain lock up period is too long

A lot can happen in two years
that i don't hold enough
I don't like the parachain auctions. Not a big fan of chains and users having to bid for slots. I'd much prefer an open source and all inclusive system like Cosmos has where anyone is free to build.
If you haven’t already, definitely compare and contrast with Cosmos. It’s the largest L0 competitor with a cheaper and easier onboarding than the convoluted and expensive crowdloan process. I say this as someone who similarly has large DOTSAMA bags as well
Besides its forced staking to fight its inflation, nothing. Dot overall is a very great project
The tag of ETH killer.

You could be an alternative platform without being a killer too, right?
Good question, I feel like I've done the same. Kind of went in hard on DOT after the price drops, but definitely believe in it. Focusing on diversifying a bit more, but it's hard to not just want more DOT. Looking forward to the answers.
It's price falling :/
I took a pretty hefty axe to my crypto before Christmas, saying goodbye to a few projects I really liked but DOT, KSM and ATOM all stayed because I enjoy using them. I'm not just buying and staring at a chart each day.

Parachains may be long term commitments but that was part of my risk evaluation. 

I will say the thing I don't like about DOT is that you need 120 to stake in their wallet. Thankfully Kraken has decent returns.
Are DOT and ATOM competing i feel like im constantly asking myself this question. Someone said DOT was more security-based and ATOM was more ecosystem driven?
Large whales are dropping it's price for a reason. I expect 12$, than they load up, for a reason.
I have a dot phobia
The name sounds like that of a Condom brand.
That founder betrayed Ethereum.

Think of all the thing they could have accomplished if the gang would have sticked together...
I Like Atom more
The question is how long interchange token transfers take timewise from one to another parachains. I tink this is still in the range of minutes and hence a bottle neck. Secondly the governace and decentralisation is also very limited 100 validators at most if am not mistaken.
I dont know about the hate, neither. I bought some DOT some months ago for diversification and hoping for the moonshot. Now the waiting game begins.

See ya in 5-10 years, folks! May the force be with you.
That despite the parachain auctioning the price didn't explode.
Overly complex for the average "investor" especially considering that Atom doesn't have all the parachain lockups, auctions etc.... 

On the flip side, those auctions are a big reason why Dot would have a lot more price action demand then Atom. 

Dot is also inflationary with no set supply. Staking currently is more complex than other coins as well.
Inflation isn't inherently bad. Staking still increases your purchasing power over time.
Feels.
On the flip side. Those auctions allow chains to have guaranteed processing of their blocks. No fees required.
Yea. I’m in Atom as well. I know Astar is integrating with Cosmos in Q1 which has me bullish on both.
Nothing except Cosmos, which is soon to integrate DOT and ETH
Cosmo inflation is actually higher then DOTs you know DOT is like 7.7% Cosmo is like 8.5%
Yea I don’t buy that tagline at all. Polkadot is a base layer so it really doesn’t compete against any layer 1s. If anything it’ll lead to a robust backing of the ETH ecosystem in my opinion. With Moonriver/Moonbeam I fell like the relationship kind of helps Ethereum become a bit more interoperable.
Yea I found most of my ‘diversifying’ to be with projects within the DOT ecosystem. Which at the end of the day, as far as risk management is concerned, isn’t really diversifying.
Well played. Yea, the ability to ‘use’ my dot and KSM is part of the reason why I feel a bit more passionate about them.
Yea. I’d like to hear an educated take on this. From what I heard, the design of DOTs base layer means that it can ‘update’ or implement‘improvements’ during runtime that’ll benefit all chains running on it, with no downtime. And keeps a kind of consistency and base unity between all of the chains. Which allows it to be really dynamic in the future. And it could theoretically ‘adapt’ how it runs or even adapt to take advantage of new tech without any real impact on runtime or how the chains themselves operate. Still don’t fully grasp if this is true, or what Atom does differently in this regard.
Trypophobia is legit. Godspeed.
Don't Google Yayoi Kusama then.
Yea, and it’s new logo looks like crap
Yea if Ethereum could’ve had a Eth2/DOT protocol that was released on the timeline of Polkadots launch crypto would be a different world.
I hear the things were not improving as they desired that's why these early co-founders of Etherium left.
Yea I hold Atom too. Why do you like it more?
Yea. Solid point. Are you suggesting that whatever ‘interoperability’ protocol can connect protocols in the fastest/most efficient way will inevitably choke out the other interoperability protocols. Or did I read that wrong?
Cross chain token trasfers on KSM take like 5 seconds compared to ATOMs 30 seconds.

KSM has over 1000 vaildators as soon as thats been tested fully Polkadot will be 1000 also and then they will increase KSMs again and test it
There are pros and cons but the cons of parachain auctions **greatly** exceed the pros imo.
Never actually considered this point.
Yeah thats the only thing I can think of that im not happy with they fked up changing the logo the old P. was nice and they only gave us two crap options to choose from .
The whole ecosystem is insane
I staking Osmo Juno ist free Money and the will Rise in Future
im big on ATOM, I dont have a valid reason but it is my #1 crypto even above BTC and ETH on my portfolio, it was incredibly stable until this huge drop
I guess time, usability and reliance are the major factors for measuring the success of an Interoperability protocol. At the same time we may not forget, which other successful Chains with most used DApps these Interoperability protocols are connected. So if the DApps built on Moonbeam suck compared to the ones on Cosmos comoarible chains then Polkadot will lose out. Also who bridges the soonest to legacy BCs will have a huge first mover Advantage, looking at BTC and ETH. Harmony for this one is leading.
Thanks yeah right forgot a 0. Yeah but keep in mind on how many parachains are connected to KSM yet and how much traffic they have on.
Yea, excellent points. As much as one could think that one protocol is superior to another I do think these points would be the actual deciding factor. That was honestly off my radar as a consideration.

Non fuckable token

Better be better movie than NFTs: The gas wars
E-A sports! It’s not in the game included
All play to earn games are also pay to win games. If nobody pays nobody earns anything.
Guess my wife won't be mad at me anymore for playing games all night over weekends
Better be a upward trend
I believe we’re still quite far from mass adoption of play to earn and I imagine it will look quite different from what we see today in DeFi.
Learn2Win
Mix of both. Need AAA titles to ape into crypto for pay to win to be successful.
This. I think you’ll be able to earn money with games but they’ll be even more pay-to-win focused than they are right now.
Can't agree more, even with the ones I've seen early adopters get such a leg up on other players

I mean pushing things back two months isn't going to adjust long term confidence
This whole market is driven by self fulfilling prophecy fueled by social media influencers.
Tldr:

**We still dont know shit and time will tell!**
Pretty much everyone expects to see 2-4 interest rates hikes and I believe a big part of latest stock market and crypto price movements show that those should already be accounted for. Unless we get even higher interest rate increases than discussed by The Fed, or anything else unexpected happens, I think that we don't have to worry about those things.
No more FUD for a while?   
  
The COMPETES act would like a word
I just feel we try to find reasons and relate it to issues all over the world when price drops but BTC is dropping because of its own
I don't really care. My money is on the Zags in March.
My birthday is in march hopefully it’ll ⬆️ by then
The average newbie around here has been hypnotized by a vocal minority on this sub. Look at the market, not news articles or big players. Just look at what the current market is doing. Anyone that thinks this is sustainable is on crack. We need corrections to move forward, and sadly this current one wasn't big enough.
We love kicking the pain can down the road

Personally I just spend my days watching porn on Brave browser. It's not much, but it's honest work, you know?
Gemini is decent
Celsius is 1%
You can earn interest on bat with gemini and celsius
Another vote for Gemini as well.  I set it up as my primary wallet for Brave rewards.  Transfers automatically.  I just have to log in once a month and stake the new BAT (they call it Earn).  Easy!
Hardcore shilling post...
Compound iirc
If you're in the UK you're out of luck, Gemini BAT staking isn't available for us

Still waiting for another platform to add support for it
BAT is 3% APY on CDC (2% without Jade/indigo stake)

Edit: 3% APY for doing 3 month staking. This does NOT include additional gains from compound interest
On Gemini it’s +1%
Probably Gemini is best bet
Blockfi?
Gemini is probably the best choice if your country is in the list 3% apy!
CDC 2%
Open up new tabs. Every 5th tab generates a new tab. Just make sure your settings are changed to allow the max ads per hour, which for US people is 10.

Also, you can use Gemini's EARN program to get a measly 2% on it. Better than nothing.
Getting free crypto for watching porn and shitposting

Is the dream Satoshi invisioned? Probably. There is some light in the world after all.
Gemini!
Sometimes you got to pump, for the pump
that's BATsh!t crazy
&#x200B;

gemini is my go to
I dont know why this made me laugh so hard
I honestly dont think this post is a shill, seems like a legit question, hell I have brave though I dont use it since its worth so little
How is this a shilling post. The guy likes BAT and is looking for best ways to earn off it. In what way is that shilling
Hardcore moronic comment.
3% if you have Jade Card
>Failing that, this can just be a general Brave appreciation thread :)

sorry just saw the line "Failing that, this can just be a general Brave appreciation thread :)" I think you are right,  im reporting this
True
Probably that squid game coin whatever tf it was
LINK is one that I've recently picked up that's way down from its ATH, about 3.5x
ICP.

Don’t hate me it’s free gains
CRO all day
ICP I think. But would never invest in such a project
Diminishing returns is mostly a fallacy. 

BTC has about 500 Trillion worth of liquidity to tap into, which even a tiny percentage of would generate more than a x2 or x3 ROI.

You could benefit from learning more about macro.
ICP. Will it ATH again? No.
No I want these prices till my next paycheck.

Then we can wonder about new ATH.
ICP!
I think SOL gave quite good Roi, while being a decent coin.
SOL, KSM, KAVA, CRO, ATOM, MINA, DOT
There are tech solid coins as well who matched medicines ROI like MATIC SOL LUNA etc.

So why bet on shitcoins
LTO
Nano
I wish XTZ would pump again.  Kicking myself for not selling like usual
With the recent influx of all the 'Inu' coins, I'm sure there must be a lot of contenders
The rug part deux
Lol, that’s what came to mind for me too
[deleted]
You could have made a fortune shorting it
Far better than any shitcoin
Watch some stupid thing called bitcoinu or etherinu be created and the next thing to “moon”
Honestly I’ve already prepared a coin for the next big Netflix show cause damn am I fuck missing out
Dude read the title gain
Most def it would have skyrocketed if I had shorted it

I’m more scared of the organic computers that’ll start reproducing and eventually take over the world as our new overlords
Quantum computing will make all existing cyber security infrastructure vulnerable in the future. Crypto will be the least of worries from a cyber security standpoint if QC breaks through to the mainstream before the rest of the world can catch up. Bank accounts would be obliterated in literal moments.
OH for fucks' sake with this shit.

There was just an article saying the opposite.

Imagine you are the government, the MILITARY knows about this. 
Do you honestly believe that the first thing they are going to say is with this tech, FINALLY WE CAN DESTROY BITCOIN! Something that what, not even 3% of the world uses?
I think there's room to update Bitcoin to make it safe no matter how powerful the computers. For now there's no need.
Anyone have information about which cryptos are actively working (in a meaningful way) to hedge against this? The only one I have read about so far is ALGO but I certainly would think other top cryptos are doing the same, right?
If it becomes what they say it has the potential to become....the last thing you have to worry about is your BTC.
Quantum torpedoes
Funny how they know the future considering quantum computers doesnt even really exist yet.
How long would it take for the Bitcoin community to agree on an upgrade for quantum resistance? I hope they are working on a solution right now
The article also acknowledges a solution to the threat of a quantum computer attack, namely, a quantum computer defense:

“Bitcoin could mitigate the security risk by hard-forking into quantum encryption”.
The stock flow death spiral will come long before that.

What do assets without any relevant creation look like? Not Gold, more like Ivory. Collector's items, not commodities.
Another one of the things that could have been a worry 10 years ago. We are far from.
TLDR; Futurists speculate that if Bitcoin freezes all development for the next 10-12 decades, quantum computers may eventually be able to get the private keys of reused addresses.

^(\*\*scary\*\*)
How do we know they are not already among us 😂
Totally. I heard about this in a 'documentary' series called Terminator. 🤣 Skynet is upon us, be cautious. 😆
Lucky enough my bank account is almost empty
You would hope so 🤷‍♂️
A lot of advances are being made. Google made an announcement last week on theirs. All major global players are working on this
https://www.scmp.com/abacus/who-what/what/article/3028246/skynet-chinas-massive-video-surveillance-network
I mean sure, but that was just one small example. Your identity would be compromised immediately. Medical records, banking records etc… would all be cracked in a matter of seconds if quantum took a massive leap forward without upgrading the existing infrastructures to support that change.
QANX QRL Probably more but I know of those two quantum resistant blockchains
It's begun! 😱🙃
Bullish on Monero... Haha
Not if it doesn’t pass
tldr; A new provision in the America Competes Act of 2022 could give the US Treasury the power to ban any financial transactions associated with money laundering risks. The rule could give Treasury unchecked discretion to ban crypto transactions. If allowed, the provision could severely hamper the crypto sector.

No app, just coingecko's portfolio tool. It's pretty neat.
CoinGecko all the way

Use “Bitcoin Ticker” app and get % movements to receive notifications. Custom, It’s great. 

You can also add a Widget to your home screen IOS and use any of your crypto apps to see real time prices without always opening your app!
Cmc portfolio is a really nice one!
Coinmarketcap

Delta. Clean UI and simple to use. Shows you everything you need to see.
You are my hero.
Gotta go traditional glazed all day mate
Me too, if she says nothing I am gaining. 🤔
I like it too. The only thing I don't like about it is that it somehow never displays the last hour or so on the graphs
im not seeing anyone else say gemini? Is it not great? it has been working amazing for me so far
Real solid. That is def in the rotation. 

This is why I am fat.

Yay or nay?
This is the tip of the iceberg. The real crash has just started
I'm glad that Microstrategy is holding or else this would have been worst.
So is it safe to sale the wash sale window has expired? Dump the market to buy up cheap for the next several weeks? Help me understand.
Whales make mistakes too. Glad most of them still seem to be committed though!
Is there any overview of whales and their BTC/ETH purchases?
The next time the bull run happens. Corporate balances gain 50 billion on balance sheets of large corporations that invested.
That's because they transferred it to somewhere else on the balance sheet.
But more whales and investment institutions choose to continue to buy more cryptocurrencies
Good
😂 yeah and the whales too aren’t selling just moving it around to try and buy it cheaper
They only keep buying more
Yeah, I have read articles where several of the big time investors are mentioned that they are waiting on 30k BTC.
There are a lot of hot girls in my Dm who wanna talk about crypto (specifically my seed phrase)
Hey girl, you like losing money? *Pulls up red portfolio across the board*
That’s one way to bag a “whale” (?)
Ay gurl wanna be in my Blockchain?

Imagine working for free for guy who is worth 100b dollars.
Literally an unpaid influencer
For freeeeeee gtfo
Sometimes in life, when people feel passionate about things, products, services, they dedicate a small amount of their personal time to educate others about said thing, product or service.

Is it really that hard for you to grasp or is money your only motivator?
I mean, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, right?
Why should someone promote Binance?
Souds pretty lame in my opinion.
CZ is high
What’s the pay? I mean if the pay is good I’ll probably even grow some wings
Maybe scam?
For the right amount of money I can be their angel and devil in the same time
Bezos: write that down
But you'll get pat on the back, just like when your boss congratulates you and then drives off in mercedes
But you get to be an Angel of the Binancian civilisation!
Yeah it's one thing to do that on your own accord, but for binance to solicit this kind of behavior given how much crypto and money they have is a bit of a slap in the nuts. 

Fuck that shit, tbh
Wild that people would be passionate to a for profit company with a billionaire CEO
With that in mind, you have been chosen to support me and my efforts by being given the chance to become a LITHDK Ethereal and donate moons to me, for free (no extra cost). In your honor I will mention you on my 101th birthday. Thank you kindly. #shottaken #plzPanOut
Why not? Its the best exchange really, although this idea is nuts
You have eyes, use them.
Maybe unpopular but id rather have a boss that is nice to me than one who is a dick regardless of the car they drive.
Each to their own really
Don’t know about Binance being the best exchange…
And you don’t have eyes for sarcasm lmao
What is more concerning is that they "beg" for it. Or atleast that is how it looks like. No good.
That’s not sarcasm, just a bad attempt at a joke.
Interesting, if they had a stock I'd be tempted
MPC tech is dope.
tldr; Shutter Governance is a tool for governance platforms to introduce shielded voting for their users. It uses threshold encryption and is designed to fix issues with misbehavior, voter apathy, and voting incentive systems. When voting, users encrypt their votes, and the votes are automatically decrypted when the voting period is over.
